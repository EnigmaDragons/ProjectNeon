  endingText: 'As your last squadmate loses consciousness, Medegeneix summons a medical
    crew to load your squad into a MedEvac. The medical crew carefully load up each
    body into the hovering vehicle. Emotionlessly, the crew carefully inject a lethal
    dose of chems into each of the would-be heroes before transport.


    A few
    more premium augments and organs should yield yet more profits in the cutthroat
    healthcare market. Your squad''s demise is certain to result in some corrupt
    corporate executive gaining a very nice bonus.'
