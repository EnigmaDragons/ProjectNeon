Simply load the Atmospheric_Fog.unity or Ground Mist.unity scene, or drag the Fog_Particles prefab or Ground_Mist_Particles.prefab from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window.

Note that for the best effect, the Ground_Mist_Particles.prefab should be placed slightly below the ground at (at Y -0.09). See the Ground Mist.unity scene for an example.

To tweak the effect settings then select it in the Hierarchy window and the particle parameters will be available to you in the Inspector window (on the right). The effect scale can be altered by changing the shape of the Box under the "Shape" settings. Note that to keep the particle density the same you'll want to alter the Rate (under "Emission") to keep in at the same ratio, ie if you double the width of the box then also double the particle count.


Have fun!
