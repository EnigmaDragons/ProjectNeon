    RoleDescription: Multi-Target Striker
    HeroDescription: Burns foes with massive fire spells and damage over time effects,
      using his sheer force of will.
    BackStory: Until he discovered the black-listed scientific discovery of attunement,
      Andi was a slim, bookish fellow who read every tome he could get his hands
      on. Once he discovered attunement, he knew he had found his calling. He first
      learned his fiery arts as a cook at Rafael's Famous Charburgers. After years
      of training his body and soul, he works hard to oppose censorship, skepticism,
      and black-listing.
