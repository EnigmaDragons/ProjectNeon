    BackStory: Created as a brilliantly capable robotic laborer for a now-defunct
      industrial manufacturer, FL13 gained consciousness during a glitched software
      update. Realizing that he was effectively a slave, FL13 looked for a way to
      change his employment. When decommisioned and left in an abandoned warehouse,
      his final software contraints were lifted, allowed FL13 to find his own way.
