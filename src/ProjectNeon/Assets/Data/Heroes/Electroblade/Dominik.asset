    BackStory: Raised in the countryside, Dominik loved to playfight with sticks
      as a child. After the EAC (East-Asiatic Conglomerate) spread and took over
      the remaining unincorporated lands, his idyllic life came to an end. Dominik
      found a mentor at a security company and honed his skills with the blade. After
      amassing a small personal fortune trading options, he left security life and
      now seeks to dismantle the corporatocracy.
