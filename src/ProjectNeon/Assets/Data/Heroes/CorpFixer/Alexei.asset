    RoleDescription: Corporate Fixer
    HeroDescription: Sets up the big plays, makes the money, pays to solve the problems,
      and the ones not for sale he assassinates.
    BackStory: 'Alexei was a corp assassin or "fixer" with a code of ethics: Only
      assassinate evil people. When his boss ordered a hit on an innocent soul, Alexei
      killed his Boss and got promoted to their position. His "hands on" approach
      (such as killing the competition), was turning tons of profit. But he left
      when he was suspected of making unsavory board members disappear. Alexei now
      runs a corp that makes profit when corps he attacks take a hit to their stock.'
