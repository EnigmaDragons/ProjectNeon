    RoleDescription: Striker
    HeroDescription: Equally skilled with guns and grenades, he uses the latest weaponry
      to decimate his foes
    BackStory: He served in one of the elite squads of the Eurasian Peacekeepers
      before Metroplex Zero became a non-nationalized region. Forced to choose between
      leaving his family and friends or leaving the Peacekeepers, he chose to resign
      his post with the Peacekeepers. Angry at being forced to leave behind his military
      ideals and squadmates, he pursues his own brand of justice and answers to no-one
      in this corrupt capitalistic economy.
