    BackStory: 'Ionus used to work a cushy job at Plasmigarchy as an electrical engineer.
      However, he had a strong affinity for wearing Novoline attire, and always wore
      his favorite outfits to work. He was fired and blacklisted for his fashion
      preferences. Now, he works as a freelancer using his engineering skills to
      fight against systemic corporate discrimination. '
