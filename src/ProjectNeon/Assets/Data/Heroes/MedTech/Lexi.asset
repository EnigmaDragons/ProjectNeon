    BackStory: Child prodigy from a wealthy corporate family. Lexi has explored many
      fields and worked several lifetimes worth of jobs during her early post-scholastic
      days. Biological Chemistry is her current field of interest, and she is damned
      great at it, just like everything else she has tried. Her history is virtually
      untraceable due to her cybersecurity skills and extensive use of aliases.
