    people to sacrifice in the prison system?\"\n\r\nTritoonico Employee 2 \"Because
    Tritoonico has a deal with the other corps, they are paying us to keep the streets
    clean of the litter\" speaking nonchalantly, as she motioned to the people lying
    in the middle of the circle\r.\n\nTritoonico Employee 2 \"Also the prison corps
    that are using prisoners for cheap labor would be very upset if we tried to cut
