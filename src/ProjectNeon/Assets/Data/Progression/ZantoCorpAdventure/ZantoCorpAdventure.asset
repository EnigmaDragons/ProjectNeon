  story: "While Metroplex Zero is supposed to be a purely collaborative region in
    which all discrimination is formally banned, ZantoCorp is making a secret power
    play to dominate this purely democratic region.\n\nSynergy Enterprises, one of
    the major market players has just been expelled from Metroplex Zero and their
    commercial licenses revoked. It's only a matter of time until all the rest of
    corporations are fully compromised, or expelled. \n\nAssemble your squad and
    find a way to put a stop to ZantoCorp's nefarious scheme."
