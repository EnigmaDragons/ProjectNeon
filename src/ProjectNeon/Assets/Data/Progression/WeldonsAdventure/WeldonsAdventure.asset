  story: "Weldon wakes up to a termination message from his corp security job. It
    states he isn't a \"culture\" fit. \n\nIn reality he knew he was being terminated
    cause he discovered the corp's illegal human trafficking. Clearly they had discovered
    his digging. \n\nUnfortunately in these sort of terminations, he knows the corp
    will be sending a clean up crew to terminate him in a more permanent manner."
