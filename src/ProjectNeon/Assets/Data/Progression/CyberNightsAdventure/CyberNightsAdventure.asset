  story: "A black hat hacker gang has been draining bank accounts every night for
    weeks. They've been featured in the news and no-one has any clue how they are
    do it. \n\nLast week, they hit yours. Now, you and your team are compeltely broke,
    except for your hidden stash of emergency credsticks.  You hired a tracer to
    discover where they are jacking in to the net, and the trace turns up Neon City
    slums as their working area. \n\nGo pay them a visit in person and get your credits
    back!"
