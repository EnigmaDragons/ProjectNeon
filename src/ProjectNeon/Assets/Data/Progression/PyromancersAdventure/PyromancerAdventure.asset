  story: "Speedy Eats has just setup shop in Andi's city, selling its synthesized
    food that secretly changes the consumer's body to no longer process other kinds
    of food, making the consumer reliant on them. \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough,
    this corporation has also started buying massive amounts of food and dumping
    it to artifically raise the prices that restaurants have to charge.\n\nAndi's
    not gonna let this shady business put an end to his favorite restaurants."
