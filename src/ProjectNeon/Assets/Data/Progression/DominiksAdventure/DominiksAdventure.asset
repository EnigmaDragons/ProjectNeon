    out other competitors in popular market in mysterious ways, and gaining corners
    on the market with some of their drugs. \n\nDominik recently shorted a TON of
    Cyanic Corp's stocks, causing many of their biggest investors to completely pull
    funding, and leaving their stock value completely ruined.\n\nCyanic's leadership
    spent a pretty penny and has managed to determine that Dominik was responsible.
    Now a Black Ops squad is headed to exact dark remuneration. "
