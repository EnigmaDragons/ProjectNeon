  story: "Metroplex Zero was supposed to be a beacon of progression. A place without
    all the restrictions and laws preventing competition. A place where Mega Corps
    couldn't treat you differently for where you shopped, worked, and slept. The
    occupants were called benefactors like they were the ones winning in this equation.
    \n\nBut with all those laws out of the way, with all that oversight gone, the
    Mega Corps were ruthless and subversive, exploiting the \"benefactors\". They
    had turned Metroplex Zero into a dystopic nightmare. \n\nWith your lack of legitimate
    records you could never immigrate properly. You are going to break in so you
    can help Metroplex Zero."
