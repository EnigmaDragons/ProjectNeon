  story: "Medigeneix is one of the region's leading medical suppliers. Unfortunately,
    one of their clinics in Metroplex Zero has deviated from normal healthcare protocols.\n\nInstead
    of transplanting organs into patients who need life-saving donations, they are
    not only keeping the donation organs, but also harvesting the organs of the at-risk
    patients, making Geneca Hospital one of the most profitable Medigeneix locations
    in the region. \n\nFind the corrupt administrators who are responsible for this
    and put a stop to their bloody operation."
  defeatConclusion: 'As your last squadmate loses consciousness, Medigeneix summons
    a medical crew to load your squad into a MedEvac. The medical crew carefully
    load up each body into the hovering vehicle. Emotionlessly, the crew carefully
    inject a lethal dose of chems into each of the would-be heroes before transport.


    A
    few more premium augments and organs should yield yet more profits in the cutthroat
    healthcare market. Your squad''s demise is certain to result in some corrupt
    corporate executive gaining a very nice bonus.'
  victoryConclusion: 'You made choices that affected many people''s lives. Hopefully,
    you can go to sleep knowing you made the best ones you could for the people of
    Metroplex Zero.


    Evil never sleeps, and neither shall your team. What other
    Mega Corp corrupt initiatives will you have to stop?'
