  story: '{[t:MegaCorps/Medigeneix]} is luring at-risk patients into their facilities
    under the pretext of offering medical treatment, but instead, they harvest their
    organs. If that''s not bad enough, those organs aren''t transplanted into patients
    who need life-saving donations, but are sold to the highest bidder.


    Find
    the corrupt administrators who are responsible for this and put a stop to their
    bloody operation.'
  defeatConclusion: 'As your last squadmate loses consciousness, {[t:MegaCorps/Medigeneix]}
    summons a medical crew to load your squad into a MedEvac. The medical crew carefully
    load up each body into the hovering vehicle. Emotionlessly, the crew carefully
    inject a lethal dose of chems into each of the would-be heroes before transport.


    A
    few more premium augments and organs should yield yet more profits in the cutthroat
    healthcare market. Your squad''s demise is certain to result in some corrupt
    corporate executive gaining a very nice bonus.'
  victoryConclusion: 'You made choices that affected many people''s lives. Hopefully,
    you can go to sleep knowing you made the best ones you could for the people of
    {[t:LocationName]}.


    Evil never sleeps, and neither shall your team. What
    other Mega Corp corrupt initiatives will you have to stop?'
