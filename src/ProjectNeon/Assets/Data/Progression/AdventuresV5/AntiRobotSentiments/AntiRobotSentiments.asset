  story: "ZantoCorp is one of the biggest corporations in Metroplex Zero and arguably
    the most powerful MegaCorp in the ICC. They specialize in advertising, surveillance,
    and information channels. \n\nOne thing that makes ZantoCorp unique is their
    hiring policy. ZantoCorp is famous for its slogan: \"We hire only humans!\" \n\nBut
    is this really meant to be pro-human or is it anti-android? There are rumors
    that someone high up in the corporate hierarchy wants to get rid of androids
    once and for all. \n\nFind out what is going on at ZantoCorp!\r"
  defeatConclusion: You lay bleeding out on the ground, reflecting that the only
    thing that will be left of you is all the data corps like ZantoCorp illegally
    collect on you.
  victoryConclusion: You stopped a robotic nightmare! these corps that are "too big
    to fail" are also "too big to not fuck up their own projects".
