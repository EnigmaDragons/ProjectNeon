  story: "Medegeneix is one of the region's leading medical suppliers. Unfortunately,
    one of their clinics in Metroplex Zero has deviated from normal healthcare protocols.\n\nInstead
    of transplanting organs into patients who need life-saving donations, they are
    not only keeping the donation organs, but also harvesting the organs of the at-risk
    patients, making Geneca Hospital one of the most profitable Medegeneix locations
    in the region. \n\nFind the corrupt administrators who are responsible for this
    and put a stop to their bloody operation."
  mapQuestPrompt: 
  defeatConclusion: 'As your last squadmate loses consciousness, Medegeneix summons
    a medical crew to load your squad into a MedEvac. The medical crew carefully
    load up each body into the hovering vehicle. Emotionlessly, the crew carefully
    inject a lethal dose of chems into each of the would-be heroes before transport.


    A
    few more premium augments and organs should yield yet more profits in the cutthroat
    healthcare market. Your squad''s demise is certain to result in some corrupt
    corporate executive gaining a very nice bonus.'
  victoryConclusion: "Anton drops to the ground. You can tell he's not going to be
    alive much longer. Your squad watches him closely, seeing if he has any expressions
    of remorse or any last words. \n\nAnton sputters and weakly spits out some blood.
    With the last of his strength, he presses a button on his wrist-implant, sending
    out a final message to his bosses at Medegeneix. Then the final light leaves
    his eyes.\n\nYou have a bad feeling that maybe he wasn't the mastermind of this
    dastardly scheme..."
