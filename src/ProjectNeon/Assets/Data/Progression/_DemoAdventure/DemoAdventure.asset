  story: "Medegeneix is one of the region's leading medical suppliers. Unfortunately,
    one of their clinics in Metroplex Zero has deviated from normal healthcare protocols.\n\nInstead
    of transplanting organs into patients who need life-saving donations, they are
    not only keeping the donation organs, but also harvesting the organs of the at-risk
    patients, making Geneca Hospital one of the most profitable Medegeneix locations
    in the regions. \n\nFind the corrupt administrators who are responsible for this
    and put a stop to their bloody operation."
