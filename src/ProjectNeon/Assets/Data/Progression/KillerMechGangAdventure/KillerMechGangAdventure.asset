  story: "Several savage murders have been committed by a bunch of new group of mechs
    near your hideout. \n\nYou assume that someone has caught wind of your unsanctioned
    group and is seeking you out. \n\nWho is controlling the robots? What secrets
    do they harbor?\n\nIt's time to mount an offensive and send a very strong message. "
