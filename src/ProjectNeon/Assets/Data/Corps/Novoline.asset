  shortDescription: Paramilitary supplier specializing in physical weapons and protection.
  description: '(Novoline is a para military group who made bank playing both sides
    of wars when, both sides realized if either side stopped paying them they would
    be dead)

    (even their employees gotta buy you know if they wanna live)'
  longDescription: 'Paramilitary supplier specializing in physical weapons and protection.

    

    Novoline
    is a megaconglomerate but most of their well-known business is concentrated in
    two key lines of business. Novoline is most known for their security services.
    In a world with no civil police, anyone who wants protection or crime solution
    services has to pay for it. Many corps outsource their security completely to
    Novoline, who provide protection via the best-trained augmented military personnel
    in the region. With any civil governance, Novoline not only delivers security
    but also criminal investigations and retributions.

    

    Novoline''s other
    key line of business is the production of kinetic tech weaponry and protection.
    They have a virtual monopoly on guns, personal protective equipment, and reinforced
    vehicles of all types. The market dominance might be reasonably warranted since
    their weapons are consistently rated extremely highly in shooting competitions
    and consumer surveys.

    

    In dark and distant fringes of the metroplex,
    a few rumors circulate about Novoline charging protection money to some businesses
    and working with shadow crime groups to ensure that there is sufficient demand
    for their services. Other rumors exist that Novoline''s crime solution service
    sometimes aren''t concerned with the facts of an incident and are tainted by
    their biggest clients'' wishes.'
  slogans:
  - Are you afraid? You're feelings on target.
  - Let us get you the protection you need.
  - Only you can protect yourself.
