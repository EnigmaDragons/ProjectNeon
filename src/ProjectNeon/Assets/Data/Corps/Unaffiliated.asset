    While there
    are significant advantages to strong brand loyalty in {[t:LocationName]}, there
    are many people who prefer to appear as unaffiliated as possible. Some are unaffiliated
    since the corporate lifestyle doesn''t really fit with their vision and they
    would rather live life in {[t:LocationName]} on their own terms. This includes
    some people who are personally wealthy or powerful and therefore have less need
    of corporate assistance. It also includes many people who are very poor or outcasts
    in society. They can''t effectively use any of the benefits offered by corporate
    employment or brand loyalty.


    There are others, such as freelancers, who
    use their lack of loyalty as a bargaining tool to cut better deals as they provide
    unconventional private services to their corporate connections via back channels.
    Others remain unaffiliated out of a sense of old-religious or old-moral obligation.
    They harbor idealistic dreams of revolutionizing {[t:LocationName]} society and
    remaking it in a different image.


    Whatever their reasons, everyone who
    is unaffiliated in {[t:LocationName]} lives a more challenging and dangerous
    life.'
