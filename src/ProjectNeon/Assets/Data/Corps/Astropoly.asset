    Astropoly are reselling masters who boast the largest
    selection of cutting-edge merchandise. While most of the other corporations are
    trying to outcompete each other with corporate espionage, proprietary product
    innovations, and cutthroat business practices, Astropoly is cutting deals at
    nice discount margins so they can be the ones selling the latest tech to consumers.

    

    They
    are friendly, with the best customer service in the business. On the backend,
    Astropoly uses robot-staffed warehouses and employs relatively few workers. Astropoly
    purchase kiosks can be found everywhere in the city, and they offer premier metaverse
    shopping experiences that are lightyears ahead of their competitors.

    

    Lest
    you think they are solely held in positive regard, there are plenty of rumors
    that Astropoly is involved in reverse engineering, product counterfeiting, privacy
    invasion, psychological manipulation, and unethical advertising practices. To
    date, no one has been able to produce sufficient public evidence for any of these
    claims, so it may just be corporate jealousy...'
