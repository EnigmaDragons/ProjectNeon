  longDescription: 'Biggest employer of human workers. Specialized in advertising,
    surveillance, and information channels.

    

    ZantoCorp is one of the
    biggest corporations due to their massive employment of human workers. Many wonder
    what ZantoCorp actually does since they require all employees to sign NDAs, and
    since they don''t have any major products. Despite the amorphous nature of their
    work, ZantoCorp is extremely popular with many different groups of benefactors.
    They also seem to be extremely well connected. Their logo seems to show up in
    just about everything, whether in meatspace or the metaverse.

    

    While
    they use some automation and a little bit of AI, ZantoCorp prides itself on being
    the most human-centric of the modern MetroCorps. They spend the most time cultivating
    cross-corporate connections, bouncing big business bills, and establishing excellent
    empathic exchanges of any group in Metroplex.

    

    Some love ZantoCorp,
    and others hate them. There are whispers that ZantoCorp might be the most powerful
    business in Metroplex Zero. However, since no one knows precisely who they are
    connected with or what they do, there is far more rumor than fact in the collective
    consciousness.'
