  description: '(This is the most secretive of all the corporations, claiming all
    their break throughs were through commune with the spirits, any disappearences
    were members ascended or went off to live as monks)

    (Rumors have spread
    saying they have partaken in human sacrifice and such as part of their spirtual
    research, they make it their business to be sickeningly nice)

    (They change
    people''s memories and mind, things are fuzzy around their events but the commonly
    enlighten people or offer up buildings, they know various dark magics so on the
    regular they offer up people that are loners that no one know)

    Tritoonico''s ornate
    temples and hyper-modern hospital buildings are very prominent sights in the
    Metroplex. Tritoonico hospitals offer treatments at super affordable prices for
    the poor and needy. They are also the preferred medical destination for some
    of the very wealthiest and most powerful corporate executives in Metroplex Zero.

    

    Tritoonico''s
    temples attract followers from all over for daily soul-focus sessions, power
    readings, and meditations. At the Tritoonico temple stores, they sell all sorts
    of mystical augments and arcane supplies. Tritoonico''s benefactors are extremely
    passionate, kind, and full of conviction.

    

    Are they a secular religion?
    Are they are cult? Are they just self-help profiteers? It''s hard to say for
    sure. While Tritoonico personnel are sickenly polite and nice, there are many,
    many odds rumors that circulate concerning Tritoonico. Rumors have spread saying
    they have partaken in human sacrifice and such as part of their spiritual research.
    There are also many rumors of disappearing persons, which devotees claim happen
    are the result of ascensions and voluntary monasticism.'
