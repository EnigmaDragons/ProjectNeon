    NNZ, (formerly News Network
    Zero) is the only official source for news in Metroplex Zero. In the past, there
    were other news companies and independent journalists, but NNZ''s monetization
    streamlining kept them in business long after other information companies went
    bankrupt or were acquired. NNZ pays top dollar to acquire any new upcoming news
    outlets, no matter how small. They also have exclusive editorial rights with
    net carriers.

    

    Fact-checking services, press release, public relations
    editorials and opinion columns are all business-to-business services offered
    by NNZ, which ensures that NNZ generally has fantastic relationships with other
    corporations and their executives.

    

    Unofficially, a few benefactors
    complain about the accuracy of the news or the fact-checking, but that''s nothing
    that every single news company hasn''t been accused of in the last few millenia.'
  slogans:
  - Facts are facts
  - News Straight From The Source
  - The Zero Facts
