  shortDescription: Using plasma to provide power to the world. Holds a virtual monopoly
    on electricity.
  description: "(Inventor of the plasma power plants that took over the market since
    then many competitors have appeared but unfortunately had to close down due to
    their plants suffering explosive reactors (the explosions seem to be plasma based))\r\n(this
    corporation has one of the worst public reputations but there is no resistance
    without power, so everything carries on)\r"

    If you need power or energy systems of any kind,
    Plasmigarchy has the product you need. Power plants, generators, batteries, chargers,
    portable energizers are Plasmigarchy''s specialties. Most of their power supplies
    command a purchase premium, although they operate with a very low operating cost,
    and last for a very long time. Many businesses and consumers cannot afford to
    purchase Plasmigarchy products right out, so they use amortized financing plans
    for their energy needs.

    

    Proponents of Plasmigarchy rave about how
    eco-sustainable plasma energy is, and how the high energy amplitudes broke through
    some previous limits in hardware and technology design.

    

    Detractors
    of Plasmigarchy claim that the only reason Plasmigarchy is successful in the
    commercial marketplace is because competing power companies seem to go bankrupt
    after accidents and sabotage at their power and research facilities. Are these
    stories true? Maybe so. Maybe not. Either way, in the Metroplex, everyone needs
    electricity, so it doesn''t matter how people feel about this MetroCorp.'
  slogans:
  - Running your world.
