## Preamble
We the Corporations of Metroplex Zero (MetroCorps), in our objectivist common vision and shared values and future, in order to come ever closer to our vision do ordain and enact this Inter-Corporate Policy (ICP), between the 8 major corporations of metroplex and form the Inter-Corporate Council (ICC) of Metroplex Zero.          

## Section 1
#### Enforcement of Inter-Corporate Policies
  
To further our vision, we the ICC have created this binding instrument, known as the Inter-Corporate Policy (ICP), through which a legal codex of enforceable inter-corporate laws may be enacted.

Any corporation wishing to enter into a legal agreement with another may sign an ICP, to which the following of all obligations described in such ICP may be enforced by all member-corporations of the Corporate-council. 

#### Sub section 1 - The three provisions of note. 
No ICP shall be used to establish taxes or a centralised governing body.<br>
An ICP’s obligations may only apply to corporations who sign it willingly.<br>
An ICP shall not and cannot rewrite nor infringe on section 1 and its provisions.<br>
 
#### Sub section 2 - The privilege of the fundamental directives.

The obligations of the fundamental directives including amendments are enforced on all corporations acting within the metroplex. Each MetroCorp is charged with uphold and enforcing all these directives, with the means of enforcement left to the exclusive direction and pleasure of each corporate body.

## Section 2
#### Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of Corporations

Inviolable and inalienable Corporate rights form the basis of every Capitalist society; respecting, protecting, ensuring, and actively promoting them shall be the duty of all Corporate entities. Every Corporation shall have the ability to exercise its rights unimpeded, provided it does not violate the rights and freedoms of the others or upset the corporate order.

The Corporate-Council of Metroplex Zero recognises the following rights and freedoms to all corporate entities: 
- Freedom of association;

- The absolute freedom to bear, manufacturer and sell products and services without restriction; 

## Section 3 
#### Fundamental Obligations of Benefactors

Central and essential are the rights of benefactors, of which the foundations of our society lie; as such the benefactor must pledge to this social contract and enact it to the fullest of their ability, dedicating their life and soul to their employer and to society. This is for ensuring the visionaries of capitalist society can work to their fullest extent, bringing Metroplex to a golden age. 

The Corporate-Council of Metroplex Zero recognises the following rights to all Benefactors: 
- The right to acquire labour, possessions and wealth at the behest of an exclusive employer; 
- The right to rent; 
- The right to servitude; 
- The right to purchase;
- The right to own things purchased or given; 

## Section 4 
#### Solidification of a Standardised Currency. 

In order to have a solidified means of exchange for goods and services, a universal and decentralised currency must be established: as such the Metroplex Credit is established and shall act as a legal tender for all commercial transactions.

MetroCorps shall accept the Metroplex Credit for the settlement of debts both public and private, as a means of exchange for commercial transactions, financial services, and meeting financial obligations. (under the provisions and exemptions stated within the MCA.)

This section does not preclude other currencies, goods, or means of payment from being permitted in commercial or personal transactions; at the discretion of each MetroCorp. (Directive 2281-“the metro-credit agreement (MCA)”)

## Section 5  
#### Prohibition on Benefactor Discrimination. (2086)

The safeguarding of a corporation's benefactor group allows for the unique stability and prosperity of metroplex zero. 

1. MetroCorps shall require that, when providing services or, where appropriate, ancillary services to clients, a MetroCorp shall act honestly, fairly and professionally no matter the affiliation of a benefactor and comply, in particular, with the principles set out in this Article.
2. All information, including marketing communications, addressed by the MetroCorps to clients or potential clients shall be fair, clear and not misleading to specific Benefactors; Marketing communications shall be clearly identifiable as such.
3. MetroCorps may not request, collect, record, document, or inquire about a benefactor's affiliation, employment status, or consumption preferences.
4. MetroCorps may not offer separate services to a benefactor regardless of their affiliation, employment status, or consumption preferences.
