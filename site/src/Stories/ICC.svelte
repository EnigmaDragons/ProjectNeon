To further our vision, we the ICC have created this binding instrument, known as the Inter-Corporate Policy (ICP), through which a legal codex of enforceable inter-corporate laws may be enacted.

Any corporation wishing to enter into a legal agreement with another may sign an ICP, to which the following of all obligations described in such ICP may be enforced by all member-corporations of the Corporate-council. 

#### Sub section 1 - The three provisions of note. 
No ICP shall be used to establish taxes or a centralised governing body.<br>
An ICP’s obligations may only apply to corporations who sign it willingly.<br>
An ICP shall not and cannot rewrite nor infringe on section 1 and its provisions.<br>
 
#### Sub section 2 - The privilege of the fundamental directives.

The obligations of the fundamental directives including amendments are enforced on all corporations acting within the metroplex.
