  const source = `If there's one thing I've learned about the people and places of Metroplex Zero, it's that they
want many, many things, augments, upgrades, gadgets, and most important of all. They want to
feel safe and secure. That's where we over at Secubotics come in. We provide the community
the best in high-tec security, be it bots, cameras, thermal scanners you name it. We make it. Our
service is the best and all the MegaCorps have no choice but to agree. I've been working for
them as a product development researcher for a while now and I have to say it's not that bad of
a place to be employed. Their gear is pretty snazzy and nothing has made me feel more safe. It
had soft padding on the inside that configured to your body shape, almost feeling as if nothing
were there. It moved naturally while also providing enough protection to stop a proton bullet.

For me, today was an especially important day. It was meeting time. Where all the executives, developers,
and analysts get together to talk about strategies for customer conversion. The meetings were
more like big brainstorming sessions. This time I had a big idea that was sure to be noticed by
the bosses. If things go right. I could be promoted to senior developer. And all the great perks
that go with it. Of course, no proper work day starts without a big hot cup of Wavewalk extra
strength latte. I usually went for caramel but this time I went for vanilla. The coffee bar at work
had a wide selection of goodies, they even had Pekinpaws breakfast loaf! But no time to eat
today. No, I had to be sure I got this right.

As I raced to the meeting room I ran into one of my fellow research developers, Maxtom, he was around
my age and we got along pretty well. He smiled at me as we continued on our way to the
meeting room.

"Any new strategies Cathrise?" Maxtom was always supportive of my ideas. He would even help
me out with some if I was in a rut.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

"Oh yes, I think the bosses will like what I have this time." I was bursting with confidence. Out of
all the researchers, I was one out of three women who were in line for senior developer. My
chances of getting picked were pretty good. I had been working there the longest and my plan
to implement the Critter Crawler Patrol Cameras after what was deemed 'The Santa Incident.'
was so far successful and lucrative.

"Whatever it is, I'm sure it's great." Maxtom and I continued through the massive hall into the
meeting room. The room was large, the walls were all large screens, two were projecting
images of Metroplex Zero and its various shops and plazas, the other was flashing the
Secubotics logo. At the head of the oval-shaped table sat our district manager, Enders. Next to
him sat the empty senior developer chair followed by our fellow colleagues. Maxtom and I took
our seats and waited for everyone else to settle in.

I took a sip of my latte, it was sweet and warm. I couldn't help but notice nearly everyone had
something to drink. Usually an indicator of a long meeting. Not a big problem really, long
meetings mean more time on the clock and more ideas to shoot across the room. Once
everyone was settled the meeting could begin. Enders stood up and pulled some charts up on
the screen behind him.

"Good morning everyone, it's meeting day yet again. Today we will discuss customer conversion
and go over any plans to increase our numbers this year. As we know. Our lowest numbers
come from the average consumer. How could us here at Secubotics make the average
customer want our services?" We spent a good portion of the meeting bouncing ideas off one
another. As a security corporation we could only offer a few services to the average consumer.
We would have to find a way to expand our brand and get people buying our product. There
were a few good ideas like upping the ante on our advertising and showing off some of our more
user friendly tech. But I knew nothing could compare to my plan. I just hoped the bosses would
agree.

When the time came for me to speak. I was pretty nervous. Sure I had gone through this a
million times at my apartment. But a hologram is nothing compared to the real thing. All eyes
were on me and I tried my best to keep my composure. I stood up and with a soft sigh I began
my pitch.

"Hello everyone, as you all know I'm Cathrise, this whole time we've been brainstorming ways
we could reach our customers in better and newer ways, so far, we've all been talking about
what we could do for the consumer. But what I'm proposing today is all about what the
consumer can do for us." I pulled up a hologram of a plain model representing the customer. As
I spoke various images appeared next to the model of the many different brands Metroplex Zero
uses and supports.

"Each consumer takes in information on a daily basis. When they get up, they choose which
morning meal to have, they go to specific shops and buy specific items. Their minds are
constantly processing this information. If we could figure out what the consumer wants on a
psychological level, we could cater to their needs more precisely than ever." I paused for a
moment to let everyone soak that in. It was a crazy idea that could require a lot of work hours,
but I would do it all myself if it meant success. I continued my pitch with a great sense of
confidence.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

"Everyone has their own specific things they enjoy. Right down to how we like to get ready for
bed. If we were to somehow monitor their thoughts and actions, we could offer things that would
guarantee sales and product usage. We already have the MegaCorps using our products each
and every day. But the needs of individuals is where I believe we could see even more
success." I let the hologram play for a bit longer before closing it out. Enders sat in his chair and
pondered what I was saying to the team. It could have gone either way. But I was more than
happy with what he said next.

"I like it." A large grin grew on his face as he stood from his chair "This is the kind of thing that
could put us at the top of the corporate food chain." I could tell he was just as excited as I was.
Everyone was looking at him with a surprised look. He usually shot down new ideas and when
something made him happy. You had better hoped it worked. I was both elated and terrified. We
spent the rest of the meeting discussing the different projects we could all work on. I was put in
charge of the whole operation. The plan was to first, find ways to study the community. Next, we
had to find a way to use the data we collect and utilize it in our tech and as a brand.
Essentially, the goal was simple: figure out what makes people tick and use that to get them to
buy our products and invest in our brand. I had split the team I was assigned into two groups.
One group would study the busiest areas of Metroplex Zero and figure out which stores are
visited the most. The second group was to come up with ways we could psychologically
evaluate each consumer in an ethical way while also getting the maximum amount of
information needed to come up with a decent outcome.

While I oversaw both teams, I was also doing a little research of my own. At first I thought this
type of study and data collecting was relatively new for a security corporation. But it turns out
something like this was implemented long ago by a long forgotten company known as Wolf
Security Forum. Once I had discovered their old records I began to dig deeper into them.
Nearly a hundred years ago. Wolf Security Forum was trying to implement a sort of implant into
consumers bodies to help with their security systems, you could activate/deactivate your system
from literally anywhere and it also monitored your vitals in case of a situation where you're being
held hostage while on the phone with the company and the perpetrator was coaxing you to lie
about your safety. From what I had gathered. It was rather successful. However there was
something that seemed off about the whole thing. Mainly the fact that this company hadn't
existed since a hundred years ago and the more I tried to find the analysts records of the
implant devices and other forms of research they had, it seemed to run cold.

Loads of documents, video files, charts, diagrams and much more research material was either
blacked out or just plain missing. It was strange. From what I did gather, it seemed that they
were able to tell when a person was in need of help just by the way they reacted to certain
situations, or rather their brains responses to fear and danger. I had spent a few days trying to
find out more and when I finally hit a wall, I knew I had to rely on help outside of Secubotics. On
one of my days off I went over to a well known freelance bar, it was called Greenthorn Industries
Hideaway Bar and Restaurant.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Now, usually I never had the need to hire a freelancer, they were usually known for getting into
more trouble than it was worth and most seemed keen to getting into trouble more often than
not. But this required contacts I just simply did not have, and freelancers we're great at digging
up all sorts of info. I had set up a meeting with a freelancer the bartender had recommended
and sat patiently at the table waiting for him. I was skimming through the holographic menu,
they had pretty much every drink at this place. I just ordered myself a Xavix energy cola with
extra ice and a caffeine boost, as well as some Xenon hot chips to munch on while I waited. It
didn't take long for the freelancer to take his seat.

"Hey there ma'am, I heard you needed some help. Name's Trev, how can I be of assistance?"
He was a pretty nice guy as far as I could tell. He seemed eager to work. He shook his leg as he
sat and waited. I wonder how long it had been since he had a big job.

"Hey there Trev, my name is Cathrise, I work for Secubotics. I am in need of some help. I've
been doing some research on an old company called Wolf Security Forum and have seemed to
reach a dead end. I need some help in getting their research records." I handed him a D-Stick
with the various files and documents I had with me that so far led to a dead end. Either because
there were no other files for that section or because nearly all the information was blocked out.
Hopefully this Trev guy could help. He took the D-Stick and placed it into his suit.

"Don't worry Cathrise, if they've hidden something, no matter how far back, I can find it for you.
I'll take my payment later on. For now, how about another drink?" He ordered us a couple more
colas and I ordered more hot chips for the table. He seemed to really enjoy the chips. We sat
and chatted for a bit, I let him know about what I had been researching so far and he proceeded
to tell me all sorts of similar jobs he had done in the past. All in all it was a nice time. I just
hoped he could find something useful for my project. All I had to do now was be patient.

Little did I know how patient I would have to be. It had been about three months. Trev and I
would keep regular contact and the things he did end up finding over time were pretty helpful.
On my end. The first two strategies seemed to be working. Using the information my teams had
been gathering we found ways to present our products to the people out in the various plazas
that were engaging and our sales were looking pretty good. For now, Enders seemed to be
happy, that's what mattered. I had to admit I was getting rather anxious, sure things were
working out for now, but if I could figure out how to literally get into the heads of our consumers.
We could become the biggest MegaCorp in Metroplex Zero.

Just when I thought I would have to wait for a few more months. Trev had messaged me. He
had asked me if we could meet at my apartment, which was fine. I sent him the coordinates and
in about half an hour he was at my door. I had let him in and offered him a seat in the kitchen.
"Want any coffee or a power drink? I think I have Wilkonbrew Power drinks." I looked through
the holographic screen on my fridge he just shrugged. 

"I'll take a latte if you have any" Trev seemed easy to please. The only latte I had was Wolfoods
Amaretto but he didn't seem to mind. I poured him a hot glass full.
"So I'm guessing since you're here you found something out?" I poured myself a glass and sat
opposite of Trev. Eager to hear his answer.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

"Oh I found something alright. I did a little digging into that Wolf Security Forum for you. Turns
out. They were only in business for about ten years max, and the reason why will blow your
mind." He took another sip of his latte and handed me a flash drive.

"It's all in there. I'm gonna warn you though. Some of it is kind of intense. But I think you'll find all
of it useful." I was excited. I paid him for all his help and he stayed for a while to talk about how
he came across this information. He wouldn't say much, but that's to be expected. Most in his
line of work got things in less than favorable ways. I didn't mind. I respect anyone who is willing
to do what it takes to make a living.

Once Trev headed out I went through the sliding door that leads into my office. I inserted the
flash drive into my holo-projector and began to read through what Trev had found. He was right.
They were only in business for about ten years, they started up as a simple residential security
company, providing simple services such as cameras, alarm systems and the like. In just three
short years they bloomed into a huge corporation. Making their own apartments and flats with
the best security available, each apartment had their own cameras and personal alarm systems
among other various security features.

After the apartments became a success, they eventually ventured into healthcare clinics, that's
when they started putting into play the idea of the implants. When I had first begun researching
Wolf Security Forum, it had seemed that the implants were just an idea pitched to the public to
see their opinion on it. But what Trev had found out was far more interesting, the reason I
couldn't find any more research notes on the implants is because Wolf Security Forum did the
research under a different name. Vopvana Tech.

Vopvana Tech was an offshoot group supported by Wolf Security Forum, when they opened the
healthcare clinics, WSF allowed Vopvana Tech to use patient records in their research for the
implants. Vopvana Tech also took in patients as a care facility. They would conduct various
experiments on the patients in their care, trying to pinpoint the exact hormones in the brain that
process fear and anxiety. In order to do this, patient's would be subjected to various forms of
mental and physical torture while their brain activity was monitored.

It was horrific, the company was brought down when a whistleblower exposed Wolf Security
Forum and Vopvana Tech, the company was brought down and nearly all records destroyed. All
the records Trev had dug up were in the old Vopvana Clinic. He also gave me blueprints the
company had for the implants and a few other experiments they were conducting. A lot of the
files had ideas and plans similar to my own. I wasn't sure how I felt. Seeing what this old
company had done for the sake of becoming a mega corporation made me feel a little unsettled.
I decided to hide my findings from the others for now. I had to figure out where they went wrong
so we wouldn't make the same mistakes.

As more time passed the strategies from both teams seemed to be working. The first team, run
by Maxtom, was in charge of developing products that were easier on the eyes. So far all the
products we did have for personal use, only came with one color set and little to no options for
customization. Maxtom and his team developed completely custom looks and uses for the
user-friendly products and even displayed them in the plazas at various kiosks and tables. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The second team was run by one of the other researchers named Marol, she helped design and
create new looks for the critter crawler cameras and even fine tuned them to listen and follow
commands from the users and stay within their residents. That way, we have the halls of the
living complexes and the residents monitored by our corporation.

We had opened up a few new locations and started offering more personal services to residents
and even providing extra security in the plazas by utilizing our facial recognition scanners on
their cameras. That way, if a thief was in the area and trying to return to a business they stole
from recently or hit another one, they would automatically be recognized and the guards can
take them off the premises.

It was going rather well, but, according to the chief of staff, Dax, Enders wanted more. He
wanted to see how far we could go. How close we could get to literally being in the minds of the
consumer and using that to steer them towards us and our business. I was unsure how we
could try and implement these methods without being so barbaric. I mean sure, you have to do
what it takes to make it to the top, but when people's lives are at stake, it's hard to figure out the
line between revolutionary and ethical.

I had spent weeks going through the old Vopvana Tech records. They were the only things left
of their existence. And possibly for the better. I knew that the punishments now were on the
harsh side, who knows what they really do to prisoners. But those laws and punishments have
been long-standing and the fact that they were brought down for their cruelty showed just how
drastic their methods were. I wanted so desperately to use their findings for our own version of
the implants, but how could I do it in a way that's not harmful to the people? Consumer or not,
we can't just go experimenting on them for our own gain.

I started looking up studies of the brain and it's various responses to certain types of anxiety and
fearful reactions that we knew so far. It was all pretty promising and there was enough
information for me to at least pitch the blueprints for the implants. As reluctant as I was, I knew
that the implants could be revolutionary for Secubotics. I took the blueprints and uploaded them
to a D-Stick. Keeping the original in my apartment was the safest option. I had everything
prepared to pitch the implants. I just hoped that the research I had was enough.

I had gotten my morning coffee and headed into the meeting room once more. When Enders
called on me. My heart was racing yet again. I stood up and pulled the blueprints out on the
holo-screen, with a deep breath I began yet another pitch.

"Good morning everyone, as you know all of our new strategies are very successful and I'm
proud to be working with such a capable group. However, I believe we can take this a step
further. What I have here could revolutionize our whole business strategy for years to come.
These small implants will be able to detect when a person is in danger using data gathered from
their vitals and alert our security guards and units in a timely manner. These small devices will
be connected to specific glands that can detect fear and anxiety. With enough testing I'm sure
we can get the implants to tell when people are in real danger." I paused for a moment and took
a deep breath before continuing.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

"However that's not all, while the implants will help our customers feel more safe, the implants
will also feed data from their mind to our servers, as the customer goes through their daily life,
the implants will be constantly taking in the information then customer does on a daily basis and
will be able to tell when they interact with something they enjoy and the things they do not enjoy.
This way, Secubotics can pinpoint what a customer enjoys and use it to our advantage."

To say Enders was excited for this plan to work was an understatement, he put a good portion
of the profits we were making to fund more research of the implants usage. I tried my best to
keep it as ethical as possible and throughout the research process I was going over everything
at least three times over. Things were going well. The only issue was finding volunteers to test
the implants sensitivity to fear. We ended up having to give extra pay to a few of the employees
and have them sign consent waivers.

Once the implants were in place, I decided the best way to test them was to come up with
scenarios in which the employee would be in a sort of 'dangerous situation.' An actor would
pose as a hostile individual and try to attack the employee while they were in the halls of our
building. While this was happening we would monitor the implants reactions. Of course, the
employees did not know that this would happen. They only knew that we were going to be
monitoring their vitals and the reactions of the implants.

We waited a few weeks before having the actors show up and when they did the results were
surprising. The implants were able to tell when the employees were scared and gave
notifications to our security system to help the 'subject in danger' and the employees were able
to deactivate the implants. One issue was, the implants would activate if, say, someone were to
play a prank on you and scare you, or if you were sleeping and suddenly woke up. They
seemed sensitive to all forms of fear rather than when someone was being attacked. I wasn't
sure how to work out the kinks and Dax wanted me to fix it right away. The good thing was the
implants seemed to be feeding in the positive responses at an alarming rate, pinging our
servers when they use products they enjoy and documenting the reaction to our files.

While things were going relatively well, I spent countless hours trying to figure out how we could
help the system differentiate between someone under attack and someone just scared by
something meager. I'm not sure how, but I came to the conclusion that we could use the model
for our eye scanners and instead of using them to scan locations and bring up specs for
something that you needed. You could use them to deactivate the alarm in case you were not in
an emergency. We could rebrand them as a package deal and offer them free when you get the
implants. The plus side would be that when a customer was using something they enjoy, their
eye scanners built-in camera would snap a photo of what products or things were nearby
causing a positive reaction. Sending the photos directly to us, further helping our teams cater to
the consumers and what they enjoy.

Enders was impressed with my idea and decided to go with it. The testing process for the eye
scanners was easy and the employees who had them were happy to have brand new scanners.
The true test was seeing if they could turn off the implants. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

We had an actor sneak up behind one of the employees during their break to scare them. The notification came up and on their
eye scanner, a question popped up, asking if the user would like to contact the authorities. They
chose the 'yes' option and one of our security guards came shortly and took the actor to the
back room. While in the back room, the employee had decided to calm himself by having a bag
of Flyroot Cheesy chips, the picture that was taken by the scanner was clear as day.

It worked. It actually worked.

We decided not to go public with the implants until we secured a contract with at least one
establishment inside of Metroplex Zero. I already had a place in mind to ask. The freelancers
bar. If we could get a few freelancers to be on board with the implants, we would be flooded with
sales. I had contacted the owner of the bar and set up a meeting with him and Dax. The owner
was pretty reasonable, he agreed to pitch the implants to the patrons of the bar if we could
equip his bar with the latest security systems we were offering to the bigger named bars. It was
an easy decision.

Before long we had freelancers of all types coming to our main building to set up appointments
for the first implant surgeries. Within a few weeks, we went live with their release. I never would
have thought that so many would want one. We were absolutely flooded with appointments.
Using our profits to open up clinics and repair centers. The repairs were not too invasive and
usually were only required when the implant devices began to malfunction or fail to send
notifications to the eye scanners. It took some time and tinkering. But Secubotics was becoming
one of the big names in Metroplex Zero. Enders definitely took notice and when the time came
to pick a new senior developer. He chose me without hesitation. It would take some time to fully
transition into my new position, but either way I was just grateful that I was able to find an ethical
solution to our problem.

More time passed and more people were buying the implants, we even had to hire styling
specialists to help us come up with more design options for the eye scanners. There were a few
new designs out there, made so they weren't too invasive for the user and even ones available
to be configured to power suits. It was amazing, seeing this become a reality, but the feeling of
dread sat deep in my stomach. I was the only one who knew the origins of this idea, the dark
practices and ethical blindness of Wolf Security Forum and Vopvana Tech. Names that were lost
to time.

I had hidden the original files and documents that Trev and I had recovered. Locked away in a
place only I knew how to get to. Even that didn't give me comfort. There were times when I
questioned pitching the implants, especially when I first witnessed the hungry look in Dax's eyes
when we first started testing them. He would always ask about the methods we were using and
how we could take them a step further. Using the excuse that it's what the big bosses like
Enders would want. I would try to ignore it and tell him to trust the process. Who knows if what
he was saying was actually true or if he was just trying to get us to work harder.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

There were times when I would get lost in thought, thinking about the consequences of
essentially experimenting on the consumers of Metroplex Zero. I decided to take a small
vacation to get my head together again. It pained me to think of how close we could have been
to becoming exactly like Wolf Security Forum. It was one of my biggest fears about this project.
Taking their personal information straight from their minds was one thing. But I couldn't imagine
what would happen if we resorted to the experiments that Vopvana and WSF we're conducting.

I was glad that we had all these new devices and more flow of MetroCreds. And I was glad that I
had actually gotten the promotion. What sat with me was all the reports, photos, and recordings
from Vopvana Tech. The images played in my mind nearly every time I closed my eyes. While I
was working, it was easy to forget about the whole thing and focus on something else. But being
home ended up being the hardest. I would often go for walks or binge watch movies to try and
not think about it. But it did not help at all, I had to talk to someone about it. So I chose the only
person that I knew I could trust to keep this quiet and someone who had seen what I had. Trev.

I had messaged him about having some coffee at my place, I even sweetened the deal by
promising him some Xenon hot chips and a half of Pekinpaws breakfast loaf. He came the very
next morning. I had the coffee ready and poured him a cup. He sat at the table, leaning his back
on the wall, I poured myself a cup and sat facing him. Trev had helped himself to the breakfast
loaf and smiled.

"Thanks for inviting me over, it's been a while. Those implants really are working out great. How
have things been going for you?" He took a bite of his slice and a sip of coffee. I took a sip of
mine and sighed.

"Well I got a promotion, we were able to implement the devices without resorting to the barbaric
practices that Wolf Security Forum were practicing." I sighed again. Just being able to mention it
to someone was a huge weight off of my shoulders. Trev nodded in agreement.

"Yeah I'm glad. That stuff was pretty intense, I hadn't seen anything like that in a while." He took
another sip of his coffee. I had shifted a bit in my seat.

"How do you deal with all of that? I haven't had a decent rest in a while, it's like all I ever see is
the images running around in my head." I had taken a second to catch my breath, I wanted so
desperately to ask him how he could be so calm after everything, I felt like the words just fell out
of my mouth.

"I was wondering how you would take it. Honestly, for me, it's something I see so often that it
hardly bothers me anymore, but when I had first seen something that gruesome. I had
nightmares for weeks. I found that putting things in a new light helps. Like with this." He took a
moment to pause and take a bigger drink of coffee before continuing.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

"Sure, the things Vopvana Tech and Wolf Security Forum did were horrible. But they already
paid for what they did. Did their victims ever get peace or closure? It's hard to say. But they
were forgotten long ago and I think that is for the better. And thanks to you, no one ever has to
remember them ever again. Sure. We remember, but personally, I'm grateful for the fact that I
was part of keeping the people from being exposed to them, and that I helped bring something
good to the people of Metroplex Zero." He went on to say that I shouldn't let this thing keep me
from enjoying my life, and from enjoying the fact that we can make a change here and now.
It was refreshing talking to him. He made me feel better about everything and he was easy to
talk to. We had spent the rest of the day chatting and talking about the various things we had
been up to since our last meeting. I thanked him for his help and I let him know that if he ever
needed anything, he could shoot me a message and I'd be there in any way I could. He smiled
and said he was always a ring away. He gave me a new sense of confidence that I seemed to
have lost. This whole ordeal had taken a number on my mental health. But Trev helped me see
that I could rise above it. And make it better for my sake, and for my fellow people of Metroplex
Zero.

From here on out, the implants had made an impact. Sure not everyone had one, and there
were people who simply hated them outright, saying we're spying on the citizens of Metroplex
Zero and have ulterior motives. I mean it was kind of true, we were using the photos the eye
scanners sent in to tweak our sales and even designs of the new models, it wouldn't be long
before we switched from pictures to live feed. But I wasn't going to let that stop me from making
more improvements to the implants and finding even more ways to keep the residents and
businesses of Metroplex Zero safe. I made it my goal to ensure their lives were as little danger
as possible and I would see to it personally that we implement strategies and make products
that are nothing less than the best option for the safety of the community. Things would be
better and I would do what I could to make that possible.

I had gone back to work, with a new sense of pride and ready to take on anything. I walked into
the office and headed towards Dax's room, I walked through the sliding doors, Wavewalk extra
strength latte in hand, and took a seat in front of his desk. He wasn't physically there. In his
chair sat a hologram of him, he had left Metroplex to take his own vacation and was talking to
me remotely, he had the biggest smile on his face.

"Hey there Ms. Senior Developer, how are you?" His grin was wide and you could see all his
teeth even through the hologram. I chuckled a bit.

"I'm good, ready to get to work." I was ready, more ready than I ever had been. My talk with Trev
really had me in a good mood.

"Great, I need you to get your team together and get the new line of eye-scanners out and ready
