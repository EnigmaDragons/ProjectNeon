I guess the one thing I always craved was some excitement. I didn't know it at the time,
but it was all I was craving this whole time. Even as I walked through the field and
approached the large brick structure, I felt the same as I ever had. The feeling of dread
and the uncertainty of the feelings of my client, who stood waiting for me near the
structure. She was a short woman, about my age. She waited patiently for me to arrive.
Just like always.

“Welcome to the Astropoly shopping center. I am Raelle, your guide to the Astroverse
Virtual Reality shopping experience.” I had recited this line at least a thousand times in
my lifetime, each day with a different face, a different theme, a different shopper. I loved
my job at Astropoly. I practically lived there, ever since the Astroverse Virtual Reality
system launched; all I did was work. Each client who installs the system into their
apartment has access to non-invasive power suit augments that transport them into our
virtual reality server, the customer chooses the theme of their worlds appearance and
the appearance of themselves for a truly immersive shopping experience, most, like the
customer I was meeting with today, opted for the ancient small town market, the virtual
world was completely immersive, sight smell, touch, taste, nearly all senses were felt
while in the virtual world.

I’ve spent twelve hours a day, six days a week, guiding people in virtual space, helping
them shop, find chat rooms, and customize their experience with virtual augments and
downloadable features for their world. It was like I was walking in a sea of conformity
and endless grind, with no hope of return. Until I met the man who would change my
entire perspective. It all started like a typical day, I had just entered the Astropoly building
and set up my office to start helping my client for the day, he was wanting to shop
around for power armor augments and order a few things for his apartment, I placed my
virtual reality goggles on my face, each set was custom made to fit your face
comfortably and help with the immersion. After entering my login information on my
holo-desk, I stood and waited as the Astroverse began to load in. The vast array of
colored pixels began to change and warp the room around me, turning itself into yet
another vast field of grass and dirt roads. My client stood in the distance, waiting for me.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

“You're the guide right?” He began speaking before I could mutter out my greeting; it
threw me off a bit.

“Yes, I am Raelle.” This guy had his eyes fixed on mine and stood with such confidence,
it was almost mesmerizing. He smiled at me before replying.

“Raelle, I am Maddax. I know that most people use your service for shopping needs, but
I am not here for that.” He sighed softly before continuing. “I am here because I want to
get to know someone like they did in the old days. I want to go on lovely walks, and talk
with you from time to time.”

“You mean like dating? That’s absolutely crazy! I have no idea who you are.” I was
flabbergasted, how could he be so bold? So confident? Am I really supposed to date
this man in virtual reality? Who even authorized his application to the Astroverse? I was
more than confused and a bit thrown off by his offer. He remained calm as if he was
expecting me to freak out.

“You don't know me, that is true, but I’m giving you the opportunity to get to know me. I
sure would like to get to know you” He smiled once more. And I let out a scoff.

“Who put you up to this?”

“If you're wondering how I found you. I applied and requested the one woman who has
been working the hardest in the Astroverse, they assigned you as my guide. I want to
give you a chance to relax and have fun while in this space, and maybe even in
Metroplex Zero.” He kept his stance. He seemed serious, but how could he? Was he
seriously suggesting spending the day just hanging out and talking?

“Who authorized this?”

“Does that really matter? This is your chance to get paid while literally doing nothing,
just hanging out. What do you say?” He held out his hand. I’m sure he was expecting
me to take it, and I did. What did I have to lose? He gripped my hand tightly and
we began to walk down the virtual street. The area had loads of cafes and restaurants,
but Maddax led us to an area away from all the shopping, another open field that
eventually led to a small park that held a single bench with seats. He held my hand until
I took my seat and he sat right across from me.

I had to admit he was handsome, tall, with short dark hair, and practically glowing green
eyes. I was grateful that the tech we had could only change our clothing’s appearance,
or else I would believe he was modifying his looks to get dates. He had a certain energy
about him that made you want to stay by his side. It was intoxicating. We spent a few
hours talking, getting to know each other; he seemed pretty sweet and looking for
genuine conversation. It was actually refreshing, not having to walk for hours on end,
helping someone go over the manual basics for the five millionth time. It was nice to
actually sit and converse with someone that wasn't in a chat room or trying to figure out
which power suit looked better on their body.

“I have to say, I’m glad I said yes, I needed this break.” I let out a soft sigh, letting my
shoulders rest and finally unclenching my jaw. This was the most relaxed I had felt in
months.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

“From what you told me, it sounds like you need it; why do you work so hard? It’s not
like you need the Metrocreds.”

“It’s a way to pass the time, sure, I have enough creds to stay home and enjoy myself,
but I don't really have any friends to go out with, and doing things by myself just seems
pathetic.” I laughed nervously, this was the first time I admitted to anyone why I worked
instead of staying home.

“Well, you have my contact link, now, let's meet out of this world some time.”

“Oh, I don't know about that. This is fun, yes, but I have a job to do.”

“Not this week you don’t, I booked you this whole week.” He looked at me with a sense
of accomplishment, like he was waiting for the right moment to tell me his plan.
“What are you saying?”

“I’m saying that for this whole week, we will be spending time here doing whatever it is
you want, as long as it is not work.”

“I can’t believe you're serious.” I was shocked, how could he be so bold? So confident?
Something in me saw that as a challenge to be bolder, more... myself.

“Fine, impress me then,” I said smugly, giving Maddax a sarcastic look.

“Well, why don't we race?” Before our eyes, two hover-cycles appeared before us. I
snorted through my nose and quickly hopped on one, he soon got on his, and we rode
off in the endless space the Astroverse gave to us; this was actually one of the features
I was most excited to try.

We rode for what felt like forever, each getting just ahead of the other. After a while, we
both stopped and began to laugh.

"What do you think? A tie?" He tried to get his words out between breaths.

"Nah, I beat you fair and square" We shared a laugh and spent the remainder of my
shift talking, going on various walks in different environments. We even sat atop a lone
island in the middle of the sea and caught virtual fish. It was a fun time, the most fun I
had in a long time.

As the week progressed, I actually started to look forward to going to work. Every
morning, I got up with a new sense of adventure and anticipation that I hadn't felt in
years. Maddax always found new and exciting ways to spend time together; whether it
was ice skating across a frozen ocean, or windsurfing on sand dunes; he always
seemed to know how to have fun. It was a few days before my week with him was up
and he decided we should have lunch atop a huge mountain range. I sat with him, and
watched as the rendered clouds made various shapes, from time to time an
advertisement from Metroplex Zero would pop up, but other than that it was heaven.
“Raelle,” He looked at me; his expression made it seem like he had something
important to say. My heart held still for a moment as he continued.

“This time we’ve been spending together is some of the best I have had in a while, and
I’d hate to see it end. I was wondering.” He stopped for a moment, seemingly gathering
his thoughts.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

“I’ve had a great time too, Dax.” I placed my hand on his shoulder; he let out a small
exhale from his nose and placed his hand on my knee.

“Rae, I know I only said I wanted to simply hang out for the week and show you a good
time. But the thought of not seeing you again hurts me so much. I hope we can meet in
real life. I promise we could have just as much fun out there as we do here.” He stopped
again, seemingly to catch his breath. I could feel him shaking. I could only imagine what
he was going through while being hooked up to the system.

“I would love that, I have loads of free time saved up. I can take some days off and we
could meet in the shopping plaza? From there we can do anything.” It took a minute, but
Maddax agreed when we finished for the day. I put in for another week of time off; they
could do without me for a week, and I knew I needed the extra break. Maddax helped
me see that my life was more than just work, and I was so grateful for him showing up in
my life.

That night, I set the mood in my apartment to relax mode, the lights dimmed and the
smell of fresh rain spritzed out of my Crystal Industries multi-scent voice-activated
diffuser, I laid on my bed, practically fantasizing about meeting Maddax, admittedly, I
was waiting for the time to go by faster so I could see him, so I could hug him and
actually feel him; like really feel his embrace. I could not believe how much I was
actually missing him. Did I have feelings for him? I wasn't %100 sure, all I knew was I
couldn't wait to see him. He was the only thing on my mind as I began to slowly drift into
a deep sleep.

When I woke up the next morning, I was more refreshed than I had ever been. I hopped
into the shower and asked my voice-activated coffee maker to brew some Flowerfly
Hazelnut Coffee. The smell filled the air of my apartment and it made me feel extra
motivated. Maddax messaged me and said he was going to grab us both Pekinpaw’s
breakfast burritos before meeting up so it gave me time to drink my coffee and enter the
shopping center info into my power suits navigation system. It wasn't too long before I
was out the door and on my way to the shopping center.

I slowly began to descend onto the landing pad that was at the west end of the
shopping center and let Dax know I was here. He sent me his coordinates and I walked
as fast as I could to find him. I scanned the area with my eye scanner and it quickly
pinpointed his location. I activated my roller treads on my boots and rolled across the
shopping center right to him. He turned away, looking in the opposite direction; once I
approached him. I tapped his shoulder and he quickly turned around. He smiled and in
a flash, he gave me a big hug. We stood there, embracing one another; it had only been
one night since we said goodbye in the Astroverse, it felt like a lifetime. After we
stopped hugging, he handed me a breakfast sandwich.

“I got us both bacon and ostrich egg sandwiches. I hope you don't mind.” His voice
sounded even more smooth and sultry and I nearly melted as he spoke.

“I don't mind at all. It’s so good to actually see you, like, really see you.” I could not
contain my excitement; being able to actually be in his presence was like a huge weight
lifted off my shoulders. We walked around the shopping center until we found an area
that offered pop-up floating benches, so we decided to try them out. We went to a small
booth that processed your payment and waited for the bench to pop up out of a small,
circular hole that was on the ground.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

After a few minutes of listening to the machines whirring, the floating bench popped 
out of the hole and assembled right before our eyes. We each took our seats and a small 
holo-screen appeared asking for our destination. Maddax was quicker on the draw and set 
it to roaming mode. After he entered the mode onto the screen, the bench floated up until 
we were high in the air and began to slowly travel forward, not really going in any particular 
direction.

We spent the whole day talking, laughing, and taking note of all the plazas that
Metroplex Zero seemed to hold. As night fell, Dax escorted me to my apartment; we
stood in front of my door, looking into each other's eyes.

“Raelle, I have to confess..” He paused for a moment and took my hand into his. My
heart was racing.

“We’ve only known each other for a short time, but I can't imagine going a day without
seeing you. Maybe... maybe we could be more than friends?” I could tell he was
incredibly nervous. I was feeling more confident than ever, without thinking. I pulled him
by the back of his head and kissed him.

It was as if the whole world had melted away.

As our relationship blossomed and flourished, I could feel the crushing weight of my
work floating away. I was grateful to Maddax. I could never repay him for freeing me of
my routine and showing me that life is more than work. I wanted the whole world to feel
the way I did, to find a person who could make them feel how Maddax made me feel. It
was then that an idea crawled into my brain. One that I knew could change the future of
the Astroverse.

I had arrived at the Astropoly building, having called a few of my managers and
co-workers for an important meeting. Usually, I would be nervous, nearly sweating, but
this time I was sure they would love my idea. As everyone sat at the large table in the
meeting room, I pulled up a few shots from my time in the Astroverse with Maddax on
the large holographic wall. Each slide shows the several different settings we had been
in during our time together in the Astroverse.

“Everyone, as we know, the Astroverse has been incredibly successful in bringing in
customers and giving them a truly immersive shopping experience. But what I propose
today could bring a whole lot more to the virtual reality we have crafted. As you can see
from the slides on the screen, the Astroverse could become so much more than a
complicated shopping network, it could be the place people fall in love.” I paused for a
moment to let everyone soak the idea in.

“We can create a dating service, Astrolove, and provide customers with profiles of other
people and if two people match, they can go on a date in the Astroverse and have a
fully custom experience, nothing is more romantic than traveling across the world,
across time, in a matter of seconds. It could revolutionize the way people explore our
virtual reality."

I wasn’t expecting the response to be so positive; everyone agreed that this type of
service could not only bring people together in new ways. but it could also entice new
customers to buy our VR kits for their apartments and flats and bring more people into
the Astroverse. It would take some time to integrate all of the changes, but they
absolutely loved the concept. If this could bring Maddax and me together, imagine what
Astrolove could do for the millions of people who lived in Metroplex Zero. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

I was excited to get the project going, but most of all I was happy to have Maddax in 
my life; he reminded me that life is more than what I had made it out to be and each day 
I spend with him is better than the last. I’m not sure how it would go for us in the future, 
but I knew I wanted to be along for the ride. It’s crazy how the want for something new could
turn into inspiration, confidence, passion, and love.
