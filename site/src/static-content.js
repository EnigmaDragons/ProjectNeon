    "In 2280, Eurasica is ruled by cutthroat hyper-capitalist megacorporations. Only you can thwart ZantoCorp's attempts to reestablish a dark tyranny. Metroplex Zero brings a new take on roguelike deckbuilding with it's party-based RPG-style combat.",

    "With 9 heroes to choose from, each has its own unique and surprising gameplay. Before each battle, scout your enemies and pick the ideal 36 cards to take on your foes. You are never forced to bring any card you don't like into battle. During your run you will be able to acquire new cards, equipment, and augments. You can get special surgical implants, level up your heroes, and manipulate corporations into giving you very nice shopping discounts.",
