#The Titan Operator
<br>
##Main Mechanic:
The Titan overheats as he performs actions.
The Titan has spinning blades. These blades have RPM. Some cards increase the RPM, others utilize that RPM and reduce it.
This makes him very strong at the start of a fight.
The fun is primarily in the deckbuilding aspect where even the best cards aren't always a good idea to add to the deck.
