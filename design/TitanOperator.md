#The Titan Operator
<br>
##Main Mechanic:
The Titan overheats as he performs actions.
The Titan has spinning blades. These blades have RPM. Some cards increase the RPM, others utilize that RPM and reduce it.
This makes him very strong at the start of a fight.
The fun is primarily in the deckbuilding aspect where even the best cards aren't always a good idea to add to the deck.


Titan's Attack is affected by RPM(~ +.5% damage/RPM)
Titan starts combat with 25 RPM. This is the baseline. Start of turn the RPM moves closer to the baseline by 1 + 1per10delta from baseline.

Titan's Spell Power is affected by Heat(~+2%/heat)
Titan starts combat with 2 Heat. He overheats when he has 10 heat.
