2 Actions/turn, starts with 2 Combo Points
When Bloodied: Apply vulnerable 1 to all enemies

He can think 1 turn into the future with the cards he has, and tries to maximize damage.
If he thinks he can get a takedown(If he would have lethal if they don’t heal) then he will do that whenever possible.(He doesn’t do this when under Blind-Rage unless it’s just the one remaining) He likes to pair Blind-rage with sweeping strikes, otherwise he prefers True to Form for his Combo Points.)

### DoubleMind:

Card-playing Logic:
Red: He doesn’t like to burn retaliation points unless they have 3. Then he focuses on whoever has the most retaliation points until they are all below 3. Then he attacks the person with the fewest.
White: He loves forgiveness. Cauterize is higher priority if he is under 30% HP. He will never play Red Focus Beam on the first turn of being white, and he will always play it on the 3rd turn of being White if he didn’t play it on the 2nd turn.


He Switches Form after being in a form for 3 turns. All red cards have a white counterpart.(Super Zapper switches to Mass Cauterize)

When attacked apply 1 Retaliation point to the attacker. Remove 1 retaliation point when he attacks.

Red Form:
Red Laser Eye - Deal 1xMGC +.2xMGC/Retaliation point. 
Zapper - Deal 1xMGC, Stun if the target has at least 3 retaliation points.
Flamer - Apply .3 MGC burn for 4 turns to all enemies
3 Super-Zapper - Deal 1xMGC to an enemy, bounce for 50% dmg, then bounce for 25% dmg. Stun each target that had at least 3 retaliation points.
Blue Laser Eye - Deal 1xMGC, they get -X armor for 5 turns.(X = retaliation points)
3 Meditate - Apply 2 Retaliation points to all enemies




White Form:
Red Focus Beam - Apply vulnerable 5
Lightning Shield - 1x Shield, when broken stun the attacker.
Cauterize - Target persons missing health turns into black health. If cast on self gain a shield equal to the amount of black health gained this way.
3 Mass-Cauterize - All missing health turns into black health. Gain a Shield equal to the ½? amount of Black Health gained this way.
Blue Mending Eye - Heal 1x Magic, gain 3 armor for 3 turns
3 Forgiveness - Remove all retaliation points, heal .4 per point removed
