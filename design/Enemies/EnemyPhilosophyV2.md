Enemy Design
By default enemies are damage dealers if they are not they don't need more interesting mechanics other than their role
if an enemy is a damage dealer they either need a extreme specific defense or a crazy passive/reaction
if the enemey has a strong defense then they can and probably should have some other gimmick in their moves they like doing (one kind like they attack twice, or they charge up and hit big, or the like apply poisons)
full healer or full tank or support don't need anything other than the cards to make them interesting
enemies only really need 3 moves to do if they are not elites
all enemies even when they don't have an extreme defense should have a preferred defense
