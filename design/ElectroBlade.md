##Paragon

The Electro Path turns ElectroBlade into a stunning off-tank that helps control the tempo of the battle. He automatically stuns enemies when he takes large amounts of damage. His Electro cards combo with each other to make them AoE and add more stuns.

The Counter Path turns ElectroBlade into a menace...when you can predict what the opponent is doing. It allows counters to trigger multiple times in a turn. And it allows him to have multiple different counters up at a time. It also allows him to sometimes retain unused counter effects from the previous turn.

The Slashing Path turns ElectroBlade into a high-damage hyper-carry that quickly builds up and slices enemies to pieces.(He's still not good at killing groups.)
