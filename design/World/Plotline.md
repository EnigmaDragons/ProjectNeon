NGN: I'm Eliza Kay, NGN Reporter, giving you all the exciting news from Metroplex Zero, and I really have something thrilling to report on today!
NGN: Synergy Enterprizes was banned and had all their assets siezed within Metroplex Zero!
NGN: Zanto Corp provided damning evidence proving they had violated the anti-corp discrimination Inter-Corp Policy. (ACDICP)
NGN: Here today I have Kol Talbot Regional Head of Zanto Corp's Metroplex Zero presence. Now Zanto Corp was working with Synergy Enterprizes before this, what happened?
Kol: Their was a lot of tension between us *directly* before we discovered a *convienent* data cache with the damning evidence. 
Kol: This is a good example of what happens to any corporation that thinks they can harm us... and the benefactors by breaking the ACDICP.
Kol: I think the other corporations will remain subservient after this... to the ACDICP of course.
*News cuts out and Weldon summarizes mission* 
Weldon: Every mega corp in the Metroplex is violating that policy but it can't be proved. 
Weldon: Kol has made it his mission to compromise the various corp data warehouses and gain complete control over Metroplex Zero by blackmailing the other mega corps into doing whatever he wants. 
Weldon: We wouldn't normally be helping the other *corrupt* mega corps but having Zanto Corp run things will be a nightmare so we are going to slow his plans down while we locate him and then remove Kol from the picture to send a message to the rest of Zanto Corp

*Before first boss*
Weldon: We have located where Zanto's corps HQ within the Metroplex is, Kol's most likely their so we are going to take him out
*After arriving*
Weldon: Something's off
Kol Over A Holo: I hope your information sources weren't compromised to send you directly into a trap, it would be a shame if I had threatened to reveal their dark secrets.
Kol Over A Holo: You are going to be field testing the first prototype of a new line of mechs at Secrbotics. Our game was fun while it lasted.

*Before Final Boss*
Weldon: This time we know exactly where Kol is, it's time to finish this
*After Arriving*
