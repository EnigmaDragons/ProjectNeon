The year is 2282 A.D. The world has been split into two major global federations.

North America, South America, and Australia are now part of the Chinese Empire. They live life according to the old Eastern way of life and collectivist philosophies.

Meanwhile, Europe, Northern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa have embraced individualism and have formed a loosely affliated highly-competitive bloc known as Eurasica. In Eurasica, corporations are the primary source of governance. They replaced traditional military and social governments since their economic power gives them a significant edge over underfunded violence, or simply social support and goodwill. Instead, megacorporations derive their power from massive wealth, combined with market saturation that serves the employment needs and ordinary life needs of its "Benefactors". In most regions of Eurasica, one single dominant megacorp effectively rules the region.

Everyone in Eurasica is a benefactor. Everyone officially has equal status in society.
People who like multiple corporations are called Polyfactors.
Bad people are referred to as Detrifactors.

Robot and android rights haven't progressed very far. While there are lot of robots and a few androids in society, they are categorixed as property and have no personal rights or status.

Metroplex Zero is a grand social experiment in central Eurasica that attempts to transcend the typically corporate geographicality. Instead, in Metroplex Zero, many megacorporations live side-by-side along with their corresponding benefactors. Officially, there is no favoritism, and all corporations hold equal status. In reality, brand loyalty is of critical importance, and competition between the megacorporations in Metroplex Zero has never been more vicious and cutthroat.

In Metroplex Zero, any agreements made by more than one megacorporation residing in Metroplex Zero (MetroCorps) are called InterCorp Policies (ICPs). These effectively carry the weight of laws from the old world, with the exception that they are enforced directly by each megacorporation by their corresponding enforcement divisions, with penalties which vary heavily in intensity. 

MetroCorps rewards their benefactors with all kinds of things. Advanced training. Costly gear. Plenty of money. Housing. Body modifications and augments. Loyalty is deeply rewarded (and disloyalty brutally punished). Despite the ethics of the MetroCorps, nearly everyone happily opts into the lifestyle of a benefactor. 

Metroplex Zero, being a polycorporate region, has recently passed an ICP against benefactor discrimination of any kind. For example, it's illegal for one benefactor to ask another benefactor which corporation(s) they are a benefactor of. Most benefactors unofficially skirt around the non-discrimination laws (Non-Disc) by decking themselves out in Boldly Branded gear. But, of course, many benefactors also attempt to engage in subterfuge by decking themselves out in a rival corporation's gear, in order to trick others. MetroCorps also have a deep need for intense security policies, and given Non-Disc, they will often shoot a benefactor on one of their premises if that benefactor is not in their corporate database.
