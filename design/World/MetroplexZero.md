The world has been split into two major global federations. 

North America, South America, and Australia are now part of the Chinese Empire. They live life according to the old Eastern way of life and collectivist philosophies. 

Meanwhile, Europe, Northern Asia and Africa have embraced individualism and have formed a loosely affliated highly-competitive bloc known as Eurasica. In Eurasica, corporation are the primary source of governance. They replaced traditional military and social governments since their economic power gives them a significant edge over underfunded violence, or simply social goodwill. Instead, corporations derive their power from massive wealth, combined with market saturation that serves the employment needs and ordinary life needs of its "Benefactors".

Everyone is a benefactor. Everyone officially has equal status in society.
People who like multiple corporations are called Polyfactors.
Bad people are called Detrifactors.

Metroplex Zero is a grand social experiment in central Eurasica that attempts to transcend the typically corporate geographicality. Instead, in Metroplex Zero, many megacorporations live side-by-side along with their corresponding Benefactors. Officially, there is no favoritism, and all corporations hold equal status. In reality, brand loyalty is of critical importance, and competition between the megacorporations in Metroplex Zero has never been more vicious and cutthroat.
