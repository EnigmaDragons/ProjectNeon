##Paragon

The Stellar path makes Lunar cards feed into Stellar cards.(Often granting bonuses to your team.)

The Solar path makes all Solar cards become modal allowing you to choose between 2 options.(The primary, and a secondary feeds into Solar. So it allows Stellar-Solar-Solar or Solar-Solar-Lunar.)

The Lunar path unlocks a unique powerful effect that occurs when you complete the Stellar-Solar-Lunar cycle.(the effect is determined by the weapon being wielded.)
